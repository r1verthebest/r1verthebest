âœ¨ I am a developer and amateur of the java programming language and I am proposed to advocate in everything in this virtual and vast community in technology, using my knowledge and making the best choices as far as possible.

I love what I do and I like even more how much I dedicate myself to this area. I chose programming because I see technology as a fundamental part of changing the world. And I'm willing to help other people who have certain difficulties in this area and I'm fit for everything in this world.
